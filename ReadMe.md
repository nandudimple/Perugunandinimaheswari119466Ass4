Closest pair of points problem solved with the Divide and Conquer algorithm in Python 3.3.0, based on multi-branched recursion. The program for two-dimensional planar case works in O(n*(log(n)) time by using the recursive divide and conquer approach. 

Inputs and outputs are as follows

Given points are = = =>  [(2, 3), (12, 30), (40, 50), (5, 1), (12, 10), (3, 4)]
Closest Pair of points are --->  (2, 3)  and  (3, 4)


Given points are = = =>  [(0, 0), (-2, 0), (4, 0), (1, 1), (3, 3), (-2, 2), (5, 2)]
Closest Pair of points are --->  (0, 0)  and  (1, 1)
